# gitignore

_An [Alfred] workflow to quickly create a `.gitignore` file from templates._

This is an [Alfred] workflow that lets users quickly combine multiple
`.gitignore` [templates] into a single file. It works offline, has suggestions
and autocomplete, and works with [Alfred] 3 and 4.

_Built with_ ‚ù§Ô∏è _and_ ü¶Ä _by [jdno]._

## CLI

Under the hood, `alfred-gitignore` is a simple command-line utility that can be
used outside of [Alfred] as well.

**CLI mode is purely for testing, and is not officially supported.**

The CLI mode requires the `--repository` argument, which must be a path to a
folder that `alfred-gitignore` can use to store its data. As with [Alfred], the
templates must be downloaded first before they can be used with other commands.

When working on `alfred-gitignore`, run the CLI with the following command:

    cargo run -- --help
